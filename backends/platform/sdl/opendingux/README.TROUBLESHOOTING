Troubleshooting
===============
Please be advised that currently games with a resolution above 320x240
are disabled on lepus due to the limited screen resolutions and relative
weak processor on these devices.

In case you need to submit a bugreport, you may find the log file at the
following path:

     /var/tmp/scummvm.log

The log file is being overwritten at every ScummVM run.
